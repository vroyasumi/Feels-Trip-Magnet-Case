## Supplies
[5x3mm Round Magnets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QHS6VSJ)

[5x1mm Self-Adhesive Foam](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L6M4PN1)

Keyboard Feet of your choice.

Super glue of your choice.

Gloves to prevent sticking.

Paper towel to wipe excess glue.

## Build Instructions (Work In Progress)

Start on one case piece at a time.

1. Dab a drop of super glue on the magnet slot.
2. Place a magnet and hold the position for 1 minute. Wipe excess glue immediately after placing the magnet if necessary.
3. Before placing another magnet, test the polarity. All of the magnets must have the same polarity. If one magnet has the opposite polarity, the enclosure will become very weak regardless of how many magnets there are. Continue testing each magnet before gluing them in place.
4. Once all magnets are placed and have been checked for similar polarity, you may add more super glue to the exposed side of the magnets if necessary.
6. Before continuing on the other case piece, study the polarity on the initial case piece to make sure that you glue the next set of magnets correctly.
7. Continue Steps 2 through 4 for the other case piece. Again, you may add more super glue to the exposed side of the magnets if necessary.
8. Once finished, leave the super glue to cure. After 10 minutes of curing, test the polarity. Be careful though--the magnets are very strong and may shift or be ripped away from the slot. If this occurs, continue to cure for an hour before testing. After an hour, you may test the polarity of each magnet. If testing is successful, please cure for another 2 hours; or 24 hours to ensure secureness.
